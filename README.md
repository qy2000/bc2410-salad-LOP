### Development using Git Branching

This is to prevent conflicts when we are pulling/pushing code. Finalised model/code will be merged into master later on.

- git branch YOUR_NAME

- git checkout YOUR_NAME

  - all uncommitted changes will remain in your git workspace

- git add .

- git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"

- git push origin YOUR_NAME
